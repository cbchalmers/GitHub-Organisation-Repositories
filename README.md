# Project Title

Manage your GitHub organisation repositories and team memberships.

## Description

Provisions repositories within your GitHub organisation, then creates a team associated to the repositores which would contain members contributing to the code.

#### Resources Provisioned

* GitHub Respositories
* GitHub Team
* Assign GitHub Team to GitHub Repository

### Prerequisites

* [Download and Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
* [Create a Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with 'repo' (full control of private repositories) scope

### Installing

* Populate github_token inside global_vars.tf with your personal access token
* Populate resource_repository.tf with the list of repositories required
* Populate resource_membership.tf with the list of GitHub accounts to invite into the organisation
* Populate resource_team.tf with a team to be within the organisation
* Populate resource_team_membership.tf with the list of members to assign into the team
* Populate resource_team_repository.tf to assign your teams to the repositories

The [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html)  command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times

```
terraform init
```

The [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state. For example, terraform plan might be run before committing a change to version control, to create confidence that it will behave as expected.

```
terraform plan
```

The [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.

```
terraform apply
```

### Removing

The [terraform destroy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html) command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.

```
terraform destroy
```
